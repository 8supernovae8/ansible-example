# Welcome to Ansible Examples!

First and foremost, for those who don't know, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and
systems easier to deploy. It allows you and your team to avoid writing scripts
or custom code to deploy and update your applications, systems, and various
classifications of network attached devices. Ansible allows you to automate in a
language that approaches plain English, with no agents to install on remote
systems and use native protocols based on device type such as SSH for
UNIX-style operating systems, WinRM for Windows systems, REST APIs (httpapi)
for REST API appliances, and many many more. Ansible is capable of speaking to
any native protocol to any device.

If you are not familiar with Ansible and have arrived here looking for a place
to start, please check out the [Getting
Started
Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html)
first.

Now that's out of the way, let's dive right in.

# Ansible Examples

This repository contains examples and recommended practices for creating
[Ansible
Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html).

Here you will find various examples of common use cases that a modern [Systems
Administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) or
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) Practitioner may find themselves
needing to automate. The goal of this repository and its contents are to provide
*examples* that are functional and offer recommended guideance and how to
accomplish certain tasks using common patterns. This repository is not
inherently meant to provide "Production Ready" automation workflows, even though
the content might be of that quality, it's certainly not a goal.

## Subdirectories

In this repository you will find a series of subdirectories, each of these is
named after the topic or technology they aim to provide and example of
automating. Inside of each of these subdirectories you will find a `README.md`
that will provide information and context about it's contents.

repository is powered by the
